            <h1>About Me</h1>

            <p>I am Md Shad Alam, a native of the Nalanda district in Bihar. Recently, I accomplished the completion
                of my Bachelor of Technology degree in the Computer Science branch at B.P. Mandal College of
                Engineering, Madhepura.

                One of my notable strengths is my ability to collaborate effectively with diverse individuals,
                valuing different perspectives. Additionally, I am known for my determination, strong work ethic,
                and disciplined approach to tasks.

                Like most individuals, I do have my areas of improvement. I tend to experience stress when tasks are
                left incomplete, driving me to prioritize prompt task completion.

                In my leisure time, I indulge in hobbies such as photo editing, cricket, and badminton. My
                short-term aspiration is to enhance my confidence in programming skills.

                Within my family, there are seven members, which includes my father who is a farmer, my mother who
                is a homemaker, and one elder sister. This encapsulates a brief overview of myself.
            </p>
